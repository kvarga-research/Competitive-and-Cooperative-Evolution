# Simulator for examining cooperating and competitive coevolution

To run the simulation create a 'parameters.json' file, similar to 'template_parameters.json' and place it next to it.
To build and run the program you have to have a Rust compiler installed on your system (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
The easiest way is to use the 'cargo' package manager, first navigate to the repository's folder, then execute the following command:

```console
cargo run --release
```

While the simulation is running the visibility of the agents inner state can be togled. Press 's' to show them or press 'h' to hide them.
