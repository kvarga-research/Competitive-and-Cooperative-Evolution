# Simulator for examining cooperating and competitive coevolution

To run the simulation create a 'parameters.json' file, similar to 'template_parameters.json' and place it next to it.
To build and run the program you have to have a Rust compiler installed on your system.
The easiest way is to use 'cargo', first navigate to the repository's folder, then execute the following command:

```console
cargo run --release
```
